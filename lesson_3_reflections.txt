When would you want to ...

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because we could make changes for experimenting or trying new thigs, that may be don't want to add to our branch untill we test it out.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks in the copy of some proyects that you don't have the permision to modify in GitHub. The clone repository is for getting the proyect into our GitHub acount or one of our Git repositories. The branches is for making some modification, taking an other way or approuch of the problem, conserving the idea on what we are working on.
